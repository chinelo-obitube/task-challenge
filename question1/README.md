Tools used for the application
1. Python
I decided to use python to write a simple application using regular expression because python helps with automation task and is easily understood. 
I also used regular expression to make sure that the input paramater is alphanumeric.

Steps to Reproduce.
1. CD into the specific folder which contains the Dockerfile and the application file.
2.  To build the image for each of the endpoint 
  ``` docker build -t short . ```
3. To run the application 
 ``` docker run short '```
 4. Check that the container is up and running 
 ``` docker ps ```
